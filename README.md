# NBAData
Python wrapper for the NBA Data API

Ever since I started programming I've wanted a way to programmatically get NBA data. Unfortunately, there has never been an easy way to do this in python

This simple wrapper serves as a way to quickly, and easily, get the json data from data.nba.net without having to trackdown the necessary parameters and endpoints. 

This is not fully accomplished yet, but is a starting point.
