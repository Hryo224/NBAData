<p>PHILADELPHIA (AP)  Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy wanted to get more energy from his first unit, especially Reggie Jackson. So, he used a new approach to Jackson's minutes and it produced high-octane results.</p><p>Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 13 of his 26 points in Detroit's dominating third quarter, and the Pistons set a season high for points while rolling to a 136-106 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night.</p><p>A day after Van Gundy told reporters he wanted to see more energy from his starting point guard, Jackson had 21 points while playing in six-minute segments.</p><p>''The energy in that first unit has not been very good,'' Van Gundy said. ''It's certainly not all on (Jackson) but they sort of follow the point guard, so let's get the pace up a little bit and attack. He was better with that tonight.''</p><p>Van Gundy reasoned that lessening Jackson's minutes would allow him to go all-out while he's playing.</p><p>''Really push himself defensively and try to get the pace of the game up on offense,'' Van Gundy said. ''Let it loose a little more and go and keep our pace up.''</p><p>Jackson played 25 minutes, down from his season average of 28, but was pleased with the end result.</p><p>''It felt good,'' he said. ''You have to respect that he made a decision, and I'm just going to go out there and leave it all on the line with the six-minute window.''</p><p>The Pistons, holding the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, had lost two of three, including Wednesday's 109-86 drubbing at New Orleans that resulted in Van Gundy calling out Jackson and contemplating starting backup point guard Ish Smith over Jackson on Saturday. Jackson, though, did make the start while Smith finished with 11 points and 13 assists in 23 minutes.</p><p>''Ish came in and did phenomenal,'' Jackson said. ''It worked well for us tonight.''</p><p>Marcus Morris scored 22 points, Tobias Harris added 20 and Andre Drummond had 14 points, 14 rebounds, four steals and three blocks, one game after getting ejected for swatting the Pelicans' Tim Frazier in the back of the head.</p><p>Already short-handed due to the loss of Joel Embiid (knee) for the season, not to mention the absence of No. 1 pick Ben Simmons (foot) all season, Philadelphia was without center Jahlil Okafor (right knee soreness) while playing the second game of a back-to-back set. Nik Stauskas had 24 points to pace the 76ers.</p><p>''When you have a really good team against nine guys in a back-to-back situation, it's a perfect storm to the environment,'' Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said.</p><p>Philadelphia was playing one night after a 105-102 home win over the Knicks. Justin Anderson, who tied his career high with 19 points Friday while playing strong defense against Carmelo Anthony, had five just points against the Pistons.</p><p>TIP-INS</p><p>Pistons: After setting an NBA mark for futility by a team attempting 10 free throws with a 3-for-17 performance from the foul line on Wednesday, the Pistons were 18 for 21 from the line against Philadelphia. ... Smith started the first 21 games of the season in place of the injured Jackson (knee). ... Detroit's previous scoring high was 125 in a 125-124 win at Portland on Jan. 7.</p><p>76ers: Gerald Henderson (hip) missed his second straight game. ... Philadelphia's 15 first-half turnovers equaled the most in any half this season.</p><p>DOMINATING THIRD</p><p>The Pistons put the game out of reach in the third quarter when they scored 39 points, their most in a third quarter this season, to expand their 67-52 halftime advantage to 106-82.</p><p>Detroit led by as many as 30 points in the period and made 17 of 28 field goals, including 4 of 9 3-pointers. Drummond had eight points and six rebounds in the period.</p><p>TOO EASY</p><p>Detroit shot a season-best 56.8 percent, making 54 of 95 field goals.</p><p>''They didn't really feel us on defense at all,'' Philadelphia's Richaun Holmes said. ''They were way too comfortable, had way too much of a rhythm. That's something we can't do.''</p><p>UP NEXT</p><p>Pistons: Host Bulls on Monday night.</p><p>76ers: Complete three-game homestand on Monday night against Milwaukee.</p>
<p>MILWAUKEE (AP)  Spencer Hawes didn't see a single minute of action in the first 11 games after he was acquired by the Milwaukee Bucks from the Charlotte Hornets last month.</p><p>He turned in a game-changing performance on Saturday night, scoring 14 second-quarter points, including back-to-back 3-pointers and an acrobatic layup while drawing a foul, to spark the Bucks to a 101-94 win over the Toronto Raptors.</p><p>Hawes, who got onto the court for the first time with his new team on Friday night with a late three-minute stint, played all 12 minutes in the quarter as the Bucks tallied 41 points, their best second-period output of the season.</p><p>''I've been fortunate to be in this league a long time now,'' Hawes said. ''That experience kind of teaches you ups, downs, staying ready, being professional when your number's called.''</p><p>He finished with 16 points, two shy of his season high, and eight rebounds in 17 minutes.</p><p>''He hasn't had the opportunity to play, but he comes to practice every day, ready to go,'' Bucks coach Jason Kidd said.</p><p>Toronto coach Dwane Casey offered a blunt assessment of Hawes' impact.</p><p>''It was a killer,'' he said. ''Spencer Hawes came in and changed the game with his 3-point shooting.''</p><p>Khris Middleton scored a season-high 24 points and Giannis Antetokounmpo had 21 for the Milwaukee, which halted a seven-game losing streak to Toronto.</p><p>Serge Ibaka led Toronto with 19 points.</p><p>Toronto led 19-12 after the first quarter, with Milwaukee making just four of 22 shots (18 percent). It marked the Bucks' lowest first-quarter point total of the season.</p><p>Sparked by Hawes, the Bucks grabbed a 53-42 lead at the half.</p><p>The Bucks entered the fourth quarter with a 13-point lead, but the Raptors got within four about halfway through the period. Back-to-back baskets by Antetokounmpo put Milwaukee back in control.</p><p>BACK-TO-BACK</p><p>Middleton played on back-to-back nights for the first time since returning last month from a torn hamstring. Middleton missed the first 50 games of the season while recovering from surgery to repair the injury.</p><p>''This is a step forward in his comeback,'' Kidd said. ''He'll be tired, but it just shows how much we missed him early in the season.''</p><p>INSIDE INFORMATION</p><p>DeMar DeRozan struggled to score and didn't reach double figures until the waning moments of the game. Teams have been focusing their attention on DeRozan with Kyle Lowry out of the lineup with a wrist injury.</p><p>''It was extremely aggressive,'' DeRozan said of Milwaukee's defense. ''Playing against (Jason Kidd's) teams, going back to the Brooklyn days, he's got a great feel playing against me with different defensive schemes. And they have Eric Hughes, an assistant coach that used to be with us. He knows me.''</p><p>TIP-INS</p><p>Raptors: DeMarre Carroll left the game in the third quarter with a sprained left ankle. ... DeRozan, who scored 32 points in Friday night's win over Washington, didn't attempt a shot from the field and was held scoreless in the first quarter. He finished with 11 points, well off his season average of 27.9. ... Ibaka and Milwaukee's Greg Monroe were whistled for a double technical foul with about 2 minutes left in the game.</p><p>Bucks: Milwaukee connected on just two of its first 18 shots and missed its first eight shots from 3-point range, including two airballs. ... F Terrence Jones was signed for the remainder of the season. New Orleans waived Jones on Feb. 23 after acquiring All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins. Jones averaged 11.5 points and 5.9 rebounds with New Orleans. ''You look at a very talented young man who can play multiple positions,'' Kidd said. ''We'll spend some time with him (on Sunday) getting him through the system, both offense and defense, and see if we can get him some minutes in Philly (on Monday).''</p><p>UP NEXT</p><p>Raptors: Play at New Orleans on Wednesday. The Raptors beat the Pelicans 108-106 in overtime in Toronto in the teams' only other meeting this season.</p><p>Bucks: Visit Philadelphia on Monday. The 76ers have won the first two of a four-game season series, including a 114-109 victory in Milwaukee on Jan. 25.</p>
<p>MIAMI (AP)  LeBron James and Kyrie Irving rested, and the Miami Heat took advantage.</p><p>Until the final seconds, that was the entire story.</p><p>Goran Dragic scored 23 points, Hassan Whiteside had 20 points and 13 rebounds, and the Heat beat the undermanned Cleveland Cavaliers 120-92 on Saturday night.</p><p>Tyler Johnson added 17 points for the Heat, who won for the 18th time in their last 22 games and made 18 3-pointers.</p><p>But tempers flared in the final seconds after the Cavaliers - the injured J.R. Smith, it seemed, in particular - took exception to Rodney McGruder's exuberant tip dunk where he made contact with Cleveland's Channing Frye with about a minute left. Benches emptied as time expired, Dion Waiters and Udonis Haslem did some pointing and shouting toward the Cavaliers, and some from both sides were playing peacemaker.</p><p>''Ado about nothing,'' Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.</p><p>Added Frye: ''It's not really a story. Tempers flared. It is what it is. It's over now. They won. Congrats.''</p><p>The teams play again in Cleveland on Monday night.</p><p>The Cavaliers fell to 0-5 this season when James isn't in the lineup, and continue to be without two other would-be starters in Kevin Love and Smith - both still recovering from surgeries. Newly signed center Andrew Bogut also wasn't with the Cavaliers.</p><p>Frye scored 21 points and Kyle Korver added 15 for the Cavaliers, who have lost their last 12 games in Miami.</p><p>''We forced them to shoot long contested shots,'' said Dragic, who had 10 points in the third as Miami built a 101-75 lead. ''And we played together on offense.''</p><p>The Heat remained 1 1/2 games behind Detroit for the No. 8 spot in the Eastern Conference race. Cleveland's lead over idle Boston for the No. 1 spot in the East was trimmed to 2 1/2 games.</p><p>Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said this wouldn't be the last time James sits before the end of the regular season. James is averaging nearly 38 minutes per game, and has played more minutes - by far - than anyone else in the NBA over the last seven seasons, in large part because he keeps leading his teams to the NBA Finals.</p><p>He's been to the last six of those, and the Cavs want to make sure he's fresh enough come playoff time to have the best possible chance at No. 7.</p><p>''He understands the big picture and what we're trying to accomplish,'' Lue said.</p><p>TIP-INS</p><p>Cavaliers: A night after setting an NBA regular-season record with 25 3-pointers, the Cavs went 11 for 27 from beyond the arc. ... James, who tackled a Heat fan in celebration after one made a halfcourt shot for $75,000 in 2013, cheered when another made a shot Saturday for 100,000 frequent-flier miles. ... Derrick Williams, as expected, was signed for the rest of the season earlier Saturday.</p><p>Heat: The 12 straight home wins against Cleveland is Miami's second-longest active such streak. The Heat have won 15 straight at home over Sacramento. ... Luke Babbitt went 3 for 4 from 3-point range, making him 20 for 30 from long range in his last 10 games.</p><p>BANTER</p><p>Cavs forward Richard Jefferson took some heckling from a fan in stride. Jefferson got asked by a courtside ticketholder why he doesn't retire, and had a quick response. ''You aren't tired of watching me,'' Jefferson said.</p><p>INJURIES</p><p>Heat forward James Johnson needed four stitches in his right elbow, and Cavaliers guard Iman Shumpert chipped two teeth.</p><p>UP NEXT</p><p>The teams meet again Monday in Cleveland. James and Irving are expected to play, and Bogut's Cavs debut is likely.</p>
<p>CHICAGO (AP)  A rhythm shooter on a team out of sync, Jamal Crawford and the Los Angeles Clippers broke out on Saturday night.</p><p>The veteran reserve came alive late, scoring 25 points to carry the visiting Clippers to a 101-91 victory over the Chicago Bulls.</p><p>''We definitely needed a win,'' Crawford said after his 10-of-17 shooting performance. ''Everything is better. The food tastes better, the flight will be better, you know, but it's a total team effort.''</p><p>Chris Paul added 17 points and Blake Griffin had 16 for Los Angeles, which lost in Milwaukee on Friday and had fallen to the fifth spot in the Western Conference standings.</p><p>Crawford, a former Bulls guard who won his third Sixth Man of the Year award last season, scored 10 points during a 14-7 spurt in the fourth quarter as the Clippers won for just the second time in six games.</p><p>''He went 1-on-1 and you can't do nothing when he is going like that,'' said Chicago's Dwyane Wade, who scored 10 points on 2-of-11 shooting. ''When they have guys making shots like that, we are taking the ball out of the basket. Our offensive rhythm is not the same as it was in the first half when we were able to get stops and go the other way.''</p><p>Jimmy Butler scored 16 points for the Bulls, who had won five of their last six games, including wins against Cleveland and Golden State.</p><p>Chicago led by 10 points five times in the second quarter, but the Clippers took control late in the third. Crawford's long 3-pointer at the buzzer closed an 18-5 Los Angeles run at the end of the period to go up 82-73.</p><p>Los Angeles then extended its lead to 96-80 midway through the fourth.</p><p>Crawford, who averages 15.3 points per game in his career and will turn 37 in two weeks, was in single digits in five of his previous six games.</p><p>''He's going to always break out,'' Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. ''I always tell him to give yourself a shooter's chance. If you don't shoot it, you have no chance of breaking out of it.''</p><p>TIP-INS</p><p>Clippers: The Clippers are 6-6 on the second of back-to-back games. In those cases, Los Angeles won its first five, then lost six in a row before Saturday's win. ... The Clippers won their first game in 10 tries after trailing at halftime on the road.</p><p>Bulls: Bobby Portis scored 11 points and was in double figures for the third straight game. It was the first such streak for him this season. ... The Bulls failed to record a blocked shot for the second time this season. ... The Bulls' 30 second-half points were a season low for any half this season. Their 12 points in the third quarter tied their fewest points in any quarter.</p><p>ALL-STAR IDEA</p><p>After Clippers teammate Chris Paul approached commissioner Adam Silver about the subject earlier in the week, veteran Paul Pierce offered his own take to AP on how to make the All-Star Game more competitive.</p><p>''Everybody would like (the game) to be a lot more competitive,'' Pierce said. ''This is something we're really going to have to put some thought into it whether it's an added incentive or something else. It may take some big money.''</p><p>Asked how big, Pierce said, ''A hundred thousand for each (player), a hundred thousand dollars. See, this is the younger generation. I'm more competitive. I would play the same way in an All-Star Game as a playoff game. So I'm saying 100,000 (dollars). I think that would be enough to get guys to play hard for one night.''</p><p>CHICAGO ROYALTY COURTSIDE</p><p>Bulls legends Horace Grant and Scottie Pippen sat courtside for the nationally televised game. Pippen won six rings for the Bulls, while Grant won three in Chicago and a fourth for the Los Angeles Lakers in 2000-01.</p><p>Chicago's Chance the Rapper, who won three Grammy Awards last month, also was courtside at the United Center.</p><p>UP NEXT</p><p>Clippers: Monday they host Boston, as Rivers will coach against his former team, which he led to the 2008 NBA title.</p><p>Bulls: Monday they are at Detroit, which is in contention with them near the bottom of the East playoff standings. The Bulls are in seventh, one game ahead of the eighth-place Pistons.</p>
<p>DENVER (AP)  With Frank Kaminsky out, the Charlotte Hornets needed someone to step up at the end of a long road trip.</p><p>It ended up being a journeyman playing on his third 10-day contract of the season.</p><p>Johnny O'Bryant scored a career-high 15 points against his former team to supplement Kemba Walker's 27, and Charlotte beat the Denver Nuggets 112-102 on Saturday night.</p><p>Nicolas Batum had 21 points and eight assists and Marvin Williams had 14 points and 12 rebounds for the Hornets, who wrapped up a seven-game road trip with an impressive victory with the help of O'Bryant.</p><p>''Johnny O'Bryant was great,'' Charlotte coach Steve Clifford said. ''It's a little bit difficult because he hasn't been here very long, but he hit a big shot and we were fairly organized when he was on the floor. He gave us a big lift.''</p><p>O'Bryant was signed Feb. 24 after playing on two 10-day contracts with Denver in January and February. He had seven points in the fourth quarter when the Hornets held off a late rally to win for just the fourth time in the last 14 games.</p><p>O'Bryant had a little inside knowledge after spending 20 days with the Nuggets, and it helped him Saturday with Kaminsky sidelined with a sprained left shoulder suffered Thursday in Phoenix.</p><p>''More than anything it gave me confidence,'' O'Bryant said of his time with Denver. ''I played well with them when I did get minutes.''</p><p>The Nuggets came out flat after two impressive road wins in the middle of the week. Nikola Jokic led them with 31 points and 14 rebounds, while Danilo Gallinari scored 22 points.</p><p>''We didn't have pace, didn't have enough purpose, didn't have energy,'' Denver coach Michael Malone said. ''When we do that, we are a lot easier to guard.''</p><p>Charlotte took the lead for good with a 17-0 run late in the first quarter and then scored the first 10 points of the third to go up 71-52.</p><p>The Hornets led by as many as 20 in the third before Denver made a run to get it under 10 on Mason Plumlee's three-point play with 7:13 left. Marco Belinelli answered with a corner 3-pointer - his only points of the game - to push the lead to 100-89.</p><p>Denver got within four with 4:33 left, but Charlotte scored nine straight, including a big 3-pointer by Walker, to go back up by 13 and closed it out at the line.</p><p>''At that moment, we weren't scoring, so I wanted to create some space and get to my shot, and that's what I did,'' Walker said. ''That's a shot I've made all year.''</p><p>TIP-INS</p><p>Hornets: Charlotte finished its longest road trip of the season with a 3-4 record. ... The Hornets held Denver to 45 percent shooting after Phoenix hit nearly 60 percent of its shots Thursday. ... Walker and Batum have combined to score at least 20 points in eight games this season.</p><p>Nuggets: G Gary Harris, the team's fourth-leading scorer, went without a point and missed the only shot he took. ... F Kenneth Faried missed his fourth straight game with low back soreness. He first hurt it against Brooklyn on Feb. 24 and hasn't played since. ... G Emmanuel Mudiay was back to third string after playing 18 minutes in Milwaukee on Wednesday.</p><p>BIG LOSS IN THE MIDDLE</p><p>Kaminsky, Charlotte's 7-foot center, is expected to miss several games. Kaminsky, who averaged 17.9 points a game since Feb. 1, was hurt in the fourth quarter of Thursday's loss to the Suns.</p><p>He will get an MRI done on the shoulder once the Hornets return home.</p><p>''Right now, it's day-to-day, depending how he progresses these next two days,'' Clifford said. ''Typically, that injury would be 10 days to two weeks.''</p><p>UP NEXT</p><p>Hornets: Host the Indiana Pacers on Monday night.</p><p>Nuggets: Host the Sacramento Kings in a battle of playoff hopefuls on Monday night.</p>
<p>HOUSTON (AP)  James Harden had a simple answer for why the Houston Rockets were so successful in the third quarter against the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday night.</p><p>''Being aggressive,'' he said. ''That's all.''</p><p>Harden scored 33 points and Clint Capela had 24 to help the Rockets build a big lead in the third quarter and coast to a 123-108 victory over the Grizzlies.</p><p>Eric Gordon added 18 points and made six of Houston's 18 3-pointers in the victory that tied the season series with the Grizzlies at 2-2.</p><p>Houston led by 15 to start the fourth quarter and was up 109-89 after an alley-oop dunk by Capela midway through the quarter. The Grizzlies resorted to intentionally fouling Capela soon after that, but he made 8 of 10 attempts before going to the bench with Houston up by 16 with about 3  1/2 minutes left.</p><p>Capela hopes his work on Saturday night will deter teams from using that technique in the future.</p><p>''I hope they know now that I can make free throws,'' he said. ''I'm working on it every day since I got in the NBA and now I see the results. I'm trying to be consistent in what I'm doing.''</p><p>Mike Conley had 23 points for the Grizzlies and JaMychal Green added 20.</p><p>The Rockets led by four in the third quarter before using a 13-7 run, with all their points from Harden, to extend their lead to 72-62 midway through the period. Harden, who finished with six 3s, made three 3-pointers in that span and capped it with a dunk.</p><p>Conley made two free throws after that before Gordon got going, making two 3-pointers in 90 seconds to fuel an 8-2 run which pushed Houston's lead to 80-66.</p><p>A layup by Green got the Grizzlies within 10 points late in the third quarter, but Houston wrapped up the period with an 8-3 spurt to make it 93-78 entering the fourth. Gordon started that run with another 3 and Harden capped it with a 3-pointer just before the buzzer.</p><p>''We stopped defending the 3-point line with discipline and it just doesn't take long with them,'' Grizzlies coach David Fizdale said.

His spirits are up, hopefully he'll be back soon.''</p><p>Blazers: The team announced that C Festus Ezeli will have surgery on his knee next week in Vail, Colorado.
